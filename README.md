## About the App
**Student Connect** is a platform designed to bring students together for collaboration, networking, and academic growth.  
Here you can **chat with classmates**, **join study groups**, **share resources**, and **stay updated on campus events**.

> *Mobile learning apps have transformed how students access help, practice concepts, and prepare for exams. This report evaluates Chegg, Brainly, and Khan Academy, three widely used study apps focusing on their UI/UX, core features, ease of use, usefulness, and impact. For each, I outline an overview, strengths and weaknesses, and an implementation hypothesis from an Android Studio perspective. I then compare all three, highlight the best features I’d adopt for a final app, and conclude with recommendations. *
